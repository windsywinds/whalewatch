This app is intended to help people track sightings of Whales, Dolphins and other marine based animals.  
Viewers can see users submited sightings of animals. Details logged are; region, animal, time, and location.  
Other users can also then confirm the sighting if they are able to see the animal and improve the integrity of the submission.  
Users can follow @WhaleWatchNZ on twitter to receive notifications everytime a new sighting is submitted

  Future features or fixes:  
  
      Pin on map - MapBoxAPI pin feature not working correctly. Currently makes duplicate pins.          
      Open in map link - make this a pop up embedded map instead of redirect to googlemaps location?  
      Pins per animal - different pin icons for each animal type, to make viewing easier on the map
